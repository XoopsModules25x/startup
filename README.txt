Module Description
This module allows an administrator to specify which module is shown at startup for a specific group after login or for anonymous users.

You can now redirect specific groups of users to a part of your site that suits them with an easy to use administration interface.

As an example you can configure your site to do this:
- Start the Content module for Anonymous users
- Start the News module for Registered users
- Start the Forum module for your forumadmins
- etc...

This module requires that you "hack" the include/checklogin.php page.
